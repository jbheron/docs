## Introduction

The Stacks 2.0 testnet is a separate blockchain, to be used for testing. It is intended for developer experimentation and not built for production-ready integrations. The testnet is frequently reset and Stacks (STX) tokens, used as fees for operations on the testnet, can be obtained for free using a [faucet](https://www.blockstack.org/testnet/faucet).

-> Stacks (STX) tokens on the testnet are different from real tokens on the mainnet. They can be obtained at no cost through the faucet.

With the completion of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain, a production-ready, stable version will be released as "mainnet". While work for the mainnet is in progress, the testnet reflects the most recent implementation of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.

## Release phases

The work towards mainnet is split up into four sequential phases:

- ✅ **Phase 1:** is a developer local setup, mono-node, assembling SIP 001, SIP 002, SIP 004 and SIP 005. With this version, developers can not only run Stacks 2.0 on their development machines, but also write, execute, and test smart contracts.
- ✅ **Phase 2:** is the current version of our public testnet. This testnet includes SIP 003, and will be an open-membership public network, where participants will be able to validate and participate in mining testnet blocks.
- ✅ **Phase 3:** is the most complex phase which implements consensus, mining, and stacking (earning BTC).
- [ ] **Phase 4** is mainly focused on testing.

-> Have a look at the [Stacks 2.0 Testnet page](https://www.blockstack.org/testnet#phases) for a roadmap, including capabilities released and planned for each phase.
