## Introduction

Transactions are the fundamental unit of execution in the Stacks blockchain. Each transaction is originated from a [Stacks 2.0 account](/understand-stacks/accounts), and is retained in the Stacks blockchain history for eternity. This guide helps you understand Stacks 2.0 transactions.

If you want to jump right in and broadcast your first transaction, try this tutorial:

-> The information on this page is based on a design proposal. You can find more conceptual details in this document: [SIP 005: Blocks, Transaction, Accounts](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md).

## Lifecycle

Transactions go through phases before being finally confirmed, and available for all, on the Stacks 2.0 network.

![Transaction lifecycle](/images/tx-lifecycle.png)

- **Generate**: Transactions are assembled according to the encoding specification.
- **Validate and sign**: Transactions are validated to confirm they are well-formed. Required signatures are filled in.
- **Broadcast**: Transactions are sent to a node.
- **Register**: A miner receives transactions, verifies, and adds them to the ["mempool"](https://academy.binance.com/glossary/mempool), a holding area for all the pending transactions.
- **Process**: Miners review the mempool and select transactions for the next block to be mined. Depending on the transaction type, different actions can happen during this step. For example, post-conditions could be verified for a token transfer, smart-contract defined tokens could be minted, or an attempt to call an existing smart contract method could be made.
- **Confirm**: Miners successfully mine blocks with a set of transactions. The transactions inside are successfully propagated to the network.

-> A transaction can have one of three states once it is registered: `pending`, `success`, or `failed`.

## Types

The Stacks 2.0 supports a set of different transaction types:

| **Type**          | **Value**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coinbase          | `coinbase`          | The first transaction in a new block (an entity holding several transactions). Used to register for block rewards. These are not manually generated and broadcasted like other types of transactions. |
| Token transfer    | `token_transfer`    | Asset transfer from a sender to a recipient                                                                                                                                                           |
| Contract deploy   | `smart_contract`    | Contract instantiation                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Contract call     | `contract_call`     | Contract call for a public, non read-only function                                                                                                                                                    |
| Poison Microblock | `poison_microblock` | Punish leaders who intentionally equivocate about the microblocks they package                                                                                                                        |

-> The current [Naming service](/naming-services/overview) is unrelated to Stacks 2.0 and there is no naming-specific transaction type. A replacement for the functionality will be implemented as a smart contract.

A sample of each transaction type can be found in the [Stacks Blockchain API response definition for transactions](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#operation/get_transaction_by_id).

~> Read-only contract call calls do **not** require transactions. Read more about it in the [network guide](/understand-stacks/network#read-only-function-calls).

## Post-conditions

Transaction post-conditions are a feature meant to limit the damage malicious smart contract developers and smart contract bugs can do in terms of destroying a user's assets. Post-conditions are executed whenever a contract is instantiated or a public method of an existing contract is executed. Whenever a post-condition fails, a transaction will be forced to abort.

Post-conditions are meant to be added by the user (or by the user's wallet software) at the moment they sign a transaction. For example, a user may append a post-condition saying that upon successful execution, their account's Stacks (STX) balance should have decreased by no more than 1 STX. If this is not the case, then the transaction would abort and the account would only pay the transaction fee of processing it.

### Attributes

Each transaction includes a field that describes zero or more post-conditions that must all be true when the transaction finishes running. A post-condition includes the following information:

| **Attribute**                                  | **Sample**                                  | **Description**                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Principal](/write-smart-contracts/principals) | `SP2ZD731ANQZT6J4K3F5N8A40ZXWXC1XFXHVVQFKE` | Sender of the transaction, can be a Stacks address or a contract                          |
| Asset name                                     | `STX`                                       | Asset to apply conditions to (could be Stacks, fungible, or non-fungible tokens)          |
| Comparator                                     | `>=`                                        | Compare operation to be applied (could define "how much" or "whether or not")             |
| Literal                                        | `1000000`                                   | Integer or boolean value used to compare instances of the asset against via the condition |

### Evaluation modes

The Stacks blockchain supports an `allow` or `deny` mode for evaluating post-conditions:

- Allow: other asset transfers not covered by the post-conditions are permitted
- Deny: no other asset transfers are permitted besides those named in the post-conditions

## Authorization

Transactions can be authorized in two ways: _standard_ and _sponsored_. The authorization determines whether or not the originating account is also the paying account. In a transaction with a standard authorization, the origin and paying accounts are the same. In a transaction with a sponsored authorization, the origin and paying accounts are distinct, and both accounts must sign the transaction for it to be valid (first the origin, then the spender).

**Sponsored transactions** enable developers and/or infrastructure operators to pay for users to call into their smart contracts, even if users do not have the Stacks (STX) to do so.

The signing flow for sponsored transactions would be to have the user first sign the transaction with their origin account with the intent of it being sponsored (i.e. the user must explicitly allow a sponsor to sign), and then have the sponsor sign with their paying account to pay for the user's transaction fee.

## Encoding

A transaction includes the following information. Multiple-byte fields are encoded as big-endian.

| **Type**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version number  | Network version. `0x80` for testnet, `0x0` for mainnet                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Chain ID        | Chain instance ID. `0x80000000` for testnet, `0x00000001` for mainnet                                                                                                                                                     |
| Authorization   | Type of authorization (`0x04` for standard, `0x05` for sponsored) and [spending conditions](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md#transaction-authorization) |
| Post-conditions | List of post-conditions, each including a [type ID and variable-length condition body](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md#transaction-post-conditions-1)  |
| Payload         | Transaction type and variable-length [payload](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md#transaction-payloads-1)                                                 |

## Construction

The easiest way to construct well-formed transactions is by [using the Stacks Transactions JS library](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/transactions#post-conditions). You can construct the following transaction types:

- Stacks token transfer
- Smart contract deploy
- Smart contract function call

When constructing transactions, it is required to set the network the transaction is intended for. This can be either mainnet or testnet. At the moment of this writing, the only available option is the [testnet network](/understand-stacks/testnet).

-> Transactions can be constructed and serialized offline. However, it is required to know the nonce and estimated fees ahead of time. Once internet access is available, the transaction can be broadcasted to the network. Keep in mind that the nonce and fee might change during offline activity, making the transaction invalid.

### Stacks Token transfer

```js
import { makeSTXTokenTransfer } from '@stacks/transactions';
import { StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';

const BigNum = require('bn.js');

const txOptions = {
  recipient: 'SP3FGQ8Z7JY9BWYZ5WM53E0M9NK7WHJF0691NZ159',
  amount: new BigNum(12345),
  senderKey: 'b244296d5907de9864c0b0d51f98a13c52890be0404e83f273144cd5b9960eed01',
  network: new StacksTestnet(),
  memo: 'test memo',
  nonce: new BigNum(0), // set a nonce manually if you don't want builder to fetch from a Stacks node
  fee: new BigNum(200), // set a tx fee if you don't want the builder to estimate
};

const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer(txOptions);
```

-> Read more about [nonces](/understand-stacks/network#nonces) in the network guide

### Smart contract deployment

```js
import { makeContractDeploy } from '@stacks/transactions';
import { StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';
const BigNum = require('bn.js');

const txOptions = {
  contractName: 'contract_name',
  codeBody: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/contract.clar').toString(),
  senderKey: 'b244296d5907de9864c0b0d51f98a13c52890be0404e83f273144cd5b9960eed01',
  network: new StacksTestnet(),
};

const transaction = await makeContractDeploy(txOptions);
```

### Smart contract function call

```js
import { makeContractCall, BufferCV } from '@stacks/transactions';
import { StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';

const BigNum = require('bn.js');

const txOptions = {
  contractAddress: 'SPBMRFRPPGCDE3F384WCJPK8PQJGZ8K9QKK7F59X',
  contractName: 'contract_name',
  functionName: 'contract_function',
  functionArgs: [bufferCVFromString('foo')],
  senderKey: 'b244296d5907de9864c0b0d51f98a13c52890be0404e83f273144cd5b9960eed01',
  // attempt to fetch this contracts interface and validate the provided functionArgs
  validateWithAbi: true,
  network: new StacksTestnet(),
};

const transaction = await makeContractCall(txOptions);
```

### Clarity value types

Building transactions that call functions in deployed clarity contracts requires you to construct valid Clarity Values to pass to the function as arguments. The [Clarity type system](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-002-smart-contract-language.md#clarity-type-system) contains the following types:

| Type             | Declaration                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tuple            | `(tuple (key-name-0 key-type-0) ...)`                        | Typed tuple with named fields                                                                                                                                                       |
| List             | `(list max-len entry-type)`                                  | List of maximum length max-len, with entries of type entry-type                                                                                                                     |
| Response         | `(response ok-type err-type)`                                | Object used by public functions to commit their changes or abort. May be returned or used by other functions as well, however, only public functions have the commit/abort behavior |
| Optional         | `(optional some-type)`                                       | Option type for objects that can either be (some value) or none                                                                                                                     |
| Buffer           | `(buff max-len)`                                             | Byte buffer with maximum length `max-len`                                                                                                                                           |
| Principal        | `principal`                                                  | Object representing a principal (whether a contract principal or standard principal)                                                                                                |
| Boolean          | `bool`                                                       | Boolean value ('true or 'false)                                                                                                                                                     |
| Signed Integer   | `int`                                                        | Signed 128-bit integer                                                                                                                                                              |

The Stacks Transactions JS library contains Typescript types and classes that map to the Clarity types, in order to make it easy to construct well-typed Clarity values in Javascript. These types all extend the abstract class `ClarityValue`.

Here are samples for Clarity value constructions using this library:

```js
// construct boolean clarity values
const t = trueCV();
const f = falseCV();

// construct optional clarity values
const nothing = noneCV();
const something = someCV(t);

// construct a buffer clarity value from an existing Buffer
const buffer = Buffer.from('foo');
const bufCV = bufferCV(buffer);

// construct signed and unsigned integer clarity values
const i = intCV(-10);
const u = uintCV(10);

// construct principal clarity values
const address = 'SP2JXKMSH007NPYAQHKJPQMAQYAD90NQGTVJVQ02B';
const contractName = 'contract-name';
const spCV = standardPrincipalCV(address);
const cpCV = contractPrincipalCV(address, contractName);

// construct response clarity values
const errCV = responseErrorCV(trueCV());
const okCV = responseOkCV(falseCV());

// construct tuple clarity values
const tupCV = tupleCV({
  a: intCV(1),
  b: trueCV(),
  c: falseCV(),
});

// construct list clarity values
const l = listCV([trueCV(), falseCV()]);
```

If you develop in Typescript, the type checker can help prevent you from creating wrongly-typed Clarity values. For example, the following code won't compile since in Clarity lists are homogeneous, meaning they can only contain values of a single type. It is important to include the type variable `BooleanCV` in this example, otherwise the typescript type checker won't know which type the list is of and won't enforce homogeneity.

```js
const l = listCV < BooleanCV > [trueCV(), intCV(1)];
```

### Setting post-conditions

The Stacks Transactions JS library supports the construction of post conditions.

Here is an example of a post condition that ensures the account's balance will only decrease by no more than 1 STX:

```js
const account = 'SP2ZD731ANQZT6J4K3F5N8A40ZXWXC1XFXHVVQFKE';
const comparator = FungibleConditionCode.GreaterEqual;
// assuming the Stacks (STX) balance before the transaction is 12346
const amount = new BigNum(12345);

const standardSTXPostCondition = makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
  account,
  comparator,
  amount
);

const postConditions = [
  makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
    postConditionAddress,
    postConditionCode,
    postConditionAmount
  )
];

const txOptions = {
  ..., // other transaction options
  postConditions: [standardSTXPostCondition]
}

const transaction = await makeContractCall(txOptions);
```

## Serialization

A well-formed transaction construct is encoded in [Recursive Length Prefix ("RLP")](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/rlp). RLP encoding results in a variable-sized byte array.

In order to broadcast transactions to and between nodes on the network, RLP data is represented in hexadecimal string (also called the **raw format**).

To support an API-friendly and human-readable representation, the [Stacks Blockchain API](/references/stacks-blockchain-api) converts transactions into a JSON format.

=> [The Stacks Transactions JS library](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js) supports serialization of transactions.

### Raw format

Broadcasting transactions directly to the Stacks Blockchain API or Node RPC API requires the transaction to be serialized and in hexadecimal representation.

```js
// to see the raw serialized tx
const serializedTx = transaction.serialize().toString('hex');

console.log(serializedTx);
```

The method above will return the following string:

```bash
8080000000040015c31b8c1c11c515e244b75806bac48d1399c77500000000000000000000000000000000000127e88a68dce8689fc94ff4c186bf8966f8d544c5129ff84d95a2459b5e8e7c39430388f6c8f85cce8c9ce5e6ec1e157116ca4a67d65ab53768b25d5fb5831939030200000000000516df0ba3e79792be7be5e50a370289accfc8c9e03200000000000f424068656c6c6f20776f726c640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

-> Transaction IDs are generated by hashing the raw transaction with [sha512/256](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/548.pdf)

### JSON format

When called the Stacks Blockchain API or Node RPC API, transactions returned will be serialized in a JSON format. Here is a token transfer transaction:

```js
{
  "tx_id": "0x19e25515652dad41ef675bd0670964e3d537b80ec19cf6ca6f1dd65d5bc642c6",
  "tx_status": "success",
  "tx_type": "token_transfer",
  "fee_rate": "180",
  "sender_address": "STJTXEJPJPPVDNA9B052NSRRBGQCFNKVS178VGH1",
  "sponsored": false,
  "post_condition_mode": "deny",
  "block_hash": "0x9080f6df3e0be0d6de67569330e547346a44c8ecd30d9d76b5edd1b49e2c22f6",
  "block_height": 3190,

  "canonical": true,
  "tx_index": 1,
  "token_transfer": {
    "recipient_address": "ST1RZG804V6Y0N4XHQD3ZE2GE3XSCV3VHRKMA3GB0",
    "amount": "10000",
    "memo": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "event_index": 0,
      "event_type": "stx_asset",
      "asset": {
        "asset_event_type": "transfer",
        "sender": "STJTXEJPJPPVDNA9B052NSRRBGQCFNKVS178VGH1",
        "recipient": "ST1RZG804V6Y0N4XHQD3ZE2GE3XSCV3VHRKMA3GB0",
        "amount": "10000"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deserializing

Serialized, raw transactions can be deserialized without access to the internet using [the Stacks Transactions JS library](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/transactions):

```js
import { BufferReader, deserializeTransaction } from '@stacks/transactions';

// receive raw transaction
const serializedTx = '808000000...';

const bufferReader = new BufferReader(Buffer.from(serializedTx));
const deserializedTx = deserializeTransaction(bufferReader);

// print memo
console.log(deserializedTx.payload.memo.content);
```

## Signature and Verification

Every transaction contains verifiable signature(s) that certify its authenticity. These signatures are generated by signing the transaction hash with the origin's private key. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used for signing, with the curve set to secp256k1. The internal structure that encapsulates the signature is the spending condition. Spending conditions include several parameters including the public key hash, nonce, fee rate and the recoverable ECDSA signature.

When constructing a transaction using the JS library, you can supply the private key and signing will be completed automatically. If you would like to sign the transaction manually, use the `TransactionSigner` class.

Below are the steps taken to generate the signature internal to the transaction library.

### Signing steps

Step 1: Generate a transaction hash for signing. This is the SHA512/256 digest of the serialized transaction before a signature is added.

Step 2: Append the authorization type, fee amount and nonce to the transaction hash to create the signature hash.

Step 3: Generate the SHA512/256 hash of the resulting string from the previous step.

Step 4: Sign the hash using ECDSA and the origin private key.

Step 5: Add the resulting recoverable ECDSA signature to the transaction spending condition.

### Single signature transaction

As the name implies a single signature transactions contains 1 signature from the origin account that authorizes a token spend or smart contract deploy/execution.

### Multi-signature transaction

For multi-sig accounts, multiple keys must sign the transaction for it to be valid.

### Sponsored transaction

A sponsored transaction is one where a second signer sets and pays the transaction fees. The origin must sign the transaction first before the sponsor signs.

## Broadcast

With a serialized transaction in the [raw format](#raw-format), it can be broadcasted to the network using the [`POST /v2/transactions`](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#operation/post_core_node_transactions) endpoint:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://stacks-node-api.blockstack.org/v2/transactions' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '<tx_raw_format>'
```

The API will respond with a `HTTP 200 - OK` if the transactions was successfully added to the mempool.

There is no explicit time constraint between the construction of a valid signed transaction and when it can be broadcasted. There are, however, some constraint to be aware of. The following reasons can deem a transaction invalid after some period:

- Token transfer: Nonce changed in-between construction and broadcast
- Contract call or deploy: Block height is evaluated (with [`at-block`](/references/language-functions#at-block)) and changed in-between construction and broadcast

## Querying

Transactions on the Stacks 2.0 network can be queried using the [Stacks Blockchain API](/references/stacks-blockchain-api). The API exposes two interfaces, a RESTful JSON API and a WebSockets API.

For convenience, a Postman Collection was created and published: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/614feab5c108d292bffa)

-> Note: The API can be easily consumed using a generated [JS client library](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/client/index.html). The generator uses an OpenAPI specification and supports other languages and frameworks.
